# ML-for-Finance

This Repo contains some of the projects I have worked on for the Course in Machine Learning for Finance provided in the program of Quantitative Finance of WU. 

The projects cover the following themes:
- use stochastic gradient descent to solve optimization problems
- use Monte Carlo Simulations to compute the payoff of Options under Euler Discretization.
- using CNN applied to the MNIST FASHION dataset to predict the garment.
- using Deep Learning and Deep hedging to compute and hedge the payoff of different types of Options, under either P or Q-martingales.
